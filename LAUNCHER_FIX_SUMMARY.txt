=== LAUNCHER DIAGNOSTICS ===

ISSUE: GUI launches but is not visible

FIXES APPLIED:
1.  Fixed Tcl/Tk library paths (Python 3.12 instead of 3.14)
2.  Updated RAG_Control_Panel.py to check Python 3.12 first
3.  Added error logging to Logs\python_errors.log
4.  Simplified launch command to use start /B

NEXT STEPS:
1. Try desktop shortcut again
2. If still not visible:
   - Run: test_gui.bat (shows errors in console)
   - Check: Logs\python_errors.log
   - Check: debug_launch.log

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
- Window opening off-screen (check taskbar for running process)
- Import errors (captured in python_errors.log)
- Tkinter initialization failure (test_gui.bat will show this)
