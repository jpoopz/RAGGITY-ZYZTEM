RAGGITY ZYZTEM 2.0 Documentation

RAGGITY ZYZTEM is a local-first RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system 
combining powerful document processing, a beautiful dark-themed desktop interface, 
and direct CLO 3D garment design control.

Vector Stores:
The system supports two vector database backends:
- FAISS: Fast and lightweight, in-memory with file persistence (default)
- ChromaDB: Feature-rich persistent storage for large-scale deployments

LLM Providers:
RAGGITY supports multiple LLM providers:
- Ollama: Local LLM inference (recommended, default)
- OpenAI: Cloud-based GPT models (requires API key)

Quick Start:
To start the system on Windows:
1. Run start_api.bat to launch the API server
2. Run run_ui.bat to open the desktop interface

The system will start at http://localhost:8000 with a CustomTkinter UI.

Features:
- Document ingestion from PDF, TXT, DOCX, and Markdown files
- Paragraph-aware chunking with overlapping windows
- Real-time system monitoring with CPU/RAM/GPU metrics
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Streaming query responses
- CLO 3D integration for garment design

Configuration:
Settings can be configured via:
1. config.yaml file in the project root
2. Environment variables (take precedence over YAML)
3. UI Settings tab for runtime changes

The system uses FAISS for vector search by default, with optional ChromaDB support
for users who need persistent, feature-rich storage capabilities.
