# Cursor Working Rules
- ALWAYS read, in this order, before planning any change:
  1) docs/AGENT_MEMORY.md
  2) docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  3) docs/COMPONENTS.md
  4) docs/ADRs/* (if present)
  5) docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.json
- For any decision that affects design/architecture or >300 lines of changes:
  - Append a 5â€“10 line entry to docs/AGENT_MEMORY.md (Decision/Why/Risks/Follow-ups).
  - If structural, add an ADR in docs/ADRs/.
- Never add secrets. Use .env.sample only.
- Never re-add ignored paths (Logs/, .chromadb/, node_modules/, __pycache__/, Lib/, site-packages/).
