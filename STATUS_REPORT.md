## üü° Current Issues / User Facing Challenges

### Issue #1: Command Execution Errors
**Problem:** User attempting to run Python scripts from incorrect directory (`C:\Users\Julian Poopat` instead of `C:\Users\Julian Poopat\Documents\Management Class\RAG_System`)

**Error Observed:**
```
C:\Python314\python.exe: can't open file 'C:\\Users\\Julian Poopat\\index_documents.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

**Attempted Solution:**
- Created `.bat` helper files for one-click execution
- Created `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` with clear directory navigation instructions
- Provided explicit path examples

**Status:** User needs guidance on proper command execution workflow

---

### Issue #2: Markdown Formatting in Command Prompt
**Problem:** User copying markdown code blocks (```) into command prompt, causing execution errors

**Errors Observed:**
```
'```' is not recognized as an internal or external command
'```powershell' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

**Attempted Solution:**
- Created plain-text command examples in documentation
- Emphasized difference between documentation formatting and actual commands

**Status:** User requires clarification on documentation vs. executable commands

---

### Issue #3: Dependency Installation Uncertainty
**Status:** 8 of 9 Python packages installed successfully. One package failed during bulk installation (likely non-critical). Individual package installation may be needed.

**Next Action Required:** Verify if failed package is essential or can be skipped
