# Launcher Refinement - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Launcher (`launch_gui.bat`)

**Before:** Complex launcher with error checking loops and process monitoring  
**After:** Simple one-time launch script

**Final Code:**
```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\Users\Julian Poopat\Documents\Management Class\RAG_System"
if not exist "Logs" mkdir "Logs"
echo [%date% %time%] Launching RAG Control Panel >> "Logs\launch.log"
start "" "C:\Users\Julian Poopat\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\pythonw.exe" "RAG_Control_Panel.py"
exit /b 0
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Single launch attempt - no loops
- ✅ No periodic re-checking
- ✅ One log entry per launch
- ✅ Exits immediately after starting GUI
- ✅ No process monitoring or heartbeat

---

### 2. Fixed Quit Behavior (`RAG_Control_Panel.py`)

**New Method:** `on_window_close()`
- Handles the window close (X button) event
- Checks if API server is actually running
- Shows prompt only if API is running
- **"Yes"** = Stops API and closes window
- **"No"** = Keeps window open (API keeps running)
- No prompt if API not running (closes immediately)

**Updated:** `quit_app()` method
- Now calls `on_window_close()` for consistent behavior
- No double-exit warnings
- Graceful shutdown

**Window Close Handler:**
```python
self.root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", self.on_window_close)
```

---

### 3. Disabled Periodic Checks

**Removed:**
- `auto_check_status()` periodic loop (30-second interval)
- Any heartbeat or relaunch mechanisms
- Status monitoring that could trigger re-launches

**Remaining:**
- Initial status check (one-time on startup)
- Manual "Health Check" button (user-initiated only)

---

## Behavior Summary

### Launch Behavior:
1. Double-click desktop shortcut
2. Launcher runs once
3. Logs single entry: `[date time] Launching RAG Control Panel`
4. Starts GUI with pythonw (silent)
5. Launcher exits immediately
6. GUI stays open

**Result:** One log entry per launch, GUI opens once and stays open

---

### Close Behavior:

**Scenario 1: API Server Running**
- User clicks X button
- Prompt appears: "API server is running. Stop it before exiting?"
- **Yes** → Stops API, closes window
- **No** → Window stays open, API keeps running

**Scenario 2: API Server Not Running**
- User clicks X button
- No prompt
- Window closes immediately

**Result:** Graceful shutdown, no double-exit warnings

---

## Verification

### Test 1: Launch Log
After launching, check `Logs\launch.log`:
- Should see one entry per launch
- Format: `[date time] Launching RAG Control Panel`
- No repeated entries
- No "Launch attempt started" spam

### Test 2: Single Window
- Double-click shortcut
- Exactly one GUI window opens
- No flickering
- Window stays open

### Test 3: Close Behavior
- Start API server (click "Start API Server")
- Click X button
- Prompt appears
- Choose "No" → Window stays open ✓
- Choose "Yes" → API stops, window closes ✓

### Test 4: No API Running
- Ensure API not running
- Click X button
- Window closes immediately (no prompt) ✓
